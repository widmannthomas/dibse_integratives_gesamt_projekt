\begin{abstract}
As IoT devices gain on popularity in sectors such as healthcare and smart home environments and as a lot of these IoT devices are battery powered and difficult to reach and maintain, it's crucial for them to have a long battery life.
Per definition, an IoT device has to connect with other devices or the internet. 
There are many communication protocols available to perform this task, but in our case we use WiFi because this technology is present in almost every home and most smart home applications use this technology.
In order to increase the battery life of such IoT devices, there are a lot of possible options available.
Three of these possible options are evaluated and described. Their impact on the energy efficiency is shown by conducting experiments.
Our results showed that using the deep sleep mode of the controller, improves the power consumption by a factor of $\approx 290$ compared to the modem sleep mode.

\section*{Acknowledgment}

The preferred spelling of the word ``acknowledgment'' in America is without 
an ``e'' after the ``g''. Avoid the stilted expression ``one of us (R. B. 
G.) thanks $\ldots$''. Instead, try ``R. B. G. thanks$\ldots$''. Put sponsor 
acknowledgments in the unnumbered footnote on the first page.
