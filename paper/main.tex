\begin{abstract}
As IoT devices gain on popularity in sectors such as healthcare and smart home environments and a lot of these IoT devices are battery powered and difficult to reach and maintain, it's crucial for them to have a long battery life.
Per definition, an IoT device has to connect with other devices or the internet. 
There may be a lot of communication protocols available that do the job but in our case, we are using WiFi because that technology is available in nearly every household and most smart home applications are using this technology.
In order to increase the battery life of such an IoT device, there are a lot of possible options available.
Three of these possible options are evaluated, described. Their impact on the energy efficiency is proved by conducting experiments.

\section*{Acknowledgment}

The preferred spelling of the word ``acknowledgment'' in America is without 
an ``e'' after the ``g''. Avoid the stilted expression ``one of us (R. B. 
G.) thanks $\ldots$''. Instead, try ``R. B. G. thanks$\ldots$''. Put sponsor 
acknowledgments in the unnumbered footnote on the first page.
