\begin{abstract}
As IoT devices gain on popularity in sectors such as healthcare and smart home environments and as a lot of these IoT devices are battery powered and difficult to reach and maintain, it's crucial for them to have a long battery life.
Per definition, an IoT device has to connect with other devices or the internet. 
There are many communication protocols available to perform this task, but in our case we use WiFi because this technology is present in almost every home and most smart home applications use this technology.
In order to increase the battery life of such IoT devices, there are a lot of possible options available.
Three of these possible options are evaluated and described. Their impact on the energy efficiency is shown by conducting experiments.
Our results showed that using the deep sleep mode of the controller, improves the power consumption by a factor of $\approx 290$ compared to the modem sleep mode.

\section{Results}


\subsection{DHCP and static IP}
When choosing between using DHCP or a static IP, the use of a static IP is definitely less power consuming. 
As seen in Fig. \ref{fig:dhcp} the connection time using DHCP is about 1.5 seconds longer compared to the connection time of using a static IP address as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:static_ip}.
Although, it is a huge factor how long the DHCP leases are.\\
A little example: You have an ESP8266-01 that is in deep sleep and wakes up every half an hour. You are using DHCP to get an IP address. 
The DHCP lease is about 20 minutes, so everytime the device wakes up and connects to the internet, a new IP address is given by the DHCP server and therefore more energy is consumed.
Is the DHCP lease about one day, a new IP address is given only once per day and on the other remaining connection establishments, the same IP address is given, so it's consuming roughly the same energy as when using a static IP address.
As seen in Fig. \ref{fig:static_boxplot}, using a static IP address consumes about 0.078$mAh$ everytime a new connection is established.
In comparison, the use of DHCP is consuming about 0.098$mAh$ in total as seen in Fig. \ref{fig:dhcp_boxplot}.
In summary. using a static IP address instead of DHCP consumes about 20.5\% less energy and when thinking of a device that wakes up 48 times a day, this will make a huge impact on the battery life.

\section*{Acknowledgment}

The preferred spelling of the word ``acknowledgment'' in America is without 
an ``e'' after the ``g''. Avoid the stilted expression ``one of us (R. B. 
G.) thanks $\ldots$''. Instead, try ``R. B. G. thanks$\ldots$''. Put sponsor 
acknowledgments in the unnumbered footnote on the first page.
