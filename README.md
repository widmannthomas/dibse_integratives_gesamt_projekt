## Welche Methoden gibt es um die Batterielaufzeit zu erh√∂hen?

### Deep sleep mode
(Does the deep sleep mode improve the energy efficiency?)
**H0:** The deep sleep has no impact on the power consumption of the system.
**H1:** The deep sleep mode improves the power consumption compared to the default operation mode.

### Static IP vs DHCP
(Does the usage of a static IP improve the energy efficiency?)
**H0:** The usage of a static IP instead of DHCP has no impact on the power consumption of the system.
**H1:** The usage of a static IP improves the power consumption compared to DHCP.

### DHCP lease time
(Has the duration of the DHCP lease time an impact on the energy efficiency?)
**H0:** The duration of the DHCP lease time has no impact on the power consumption.
**H1:** An increase of the DHCP lease time improves the energy efficiency.
